The idea for this project revolved around the game Wizard101, a massive MMO game. In particular, the 4v4 game mode is one of interest, 
and I decided to work towards building that by allowing users to set up their match, customize their deck setups, and fight in battle eventually. 
Completed as of Now: 
1. Deck setups completed
2. Gear setups completed
3. Match countdown for both teams before actual match starts.
